## How is longdistance riding different from an average cycling trip

Compared to shorter bike rides there are a few things you might wanna consider when riding long distances:

* packing: how do you transport your stuff on your bikes, bag setups...
* eating: how do you make sure to provide the required energy to your body...
* sleeping: at some point you have to sleep
* visibility and lighting: you will ride through the night, light setup, visibility...
* navigating: basically the same as during short rides but you have to manage much longer tracks with checkpoints etc.

The following sections provide some details for each of these topics.

## Which bike to use for longdistance riding

## Proper bike setup

* handlebars / aerobars / bar tape
  * thicker bar tape for shock absorption
  * additional gel inserts under the bar tape for shock absorption
    * make sure to add them in the right place (eg. close to the lever in the top position)
  * check the rules of the race whether aerobars are allowed - sometimes there are limitations
* saddle
* gears
  * provide easier gears than you usually ride (you will need them most likely)
* pedals
  * don't start experimenting with pedals during a brevet - use what you are used to / know best
  * make sure to have them not too tight, your bones and muscles might need some additional movement for relaxiation
* tires
  * high pressure is not always better
  * check the road conditions and use wider tires for comfort and shock absorption
* visibility of your bike
  * add reflective stickers all over your bike (doesn't look good, but allows you to be seen during the night)

## Riding at night

* visibility
  * reflective stickers
* animals
  * drive slowly in forests
  * drive more in the middle of the road to be able to "escape" animals jumping into the road from the side

## Lighting

* battery versus dynamo
* charging on the road
  * put a sock over your bike computer when you charge your batteries at a check point (reminds you to pick them up again)
* backups
  * have 2 rear lights as a default
* helmet vs handlebar - shermer's neck

## Electronics

* keep your computer dry
  * take a small plastic bag with you that allows you to wrap your computer
  * the computer might not be as water proof as the manual says
* watch for charging sockets not to get wet
  * you can empty a powerbank in no time if water gets into the socket

## Navigation

* smartphone vs. cycling computer
  * battery consumption of smart phones!
  * operability of smarth phones if the display gets wet
  * charging in rainy conditions
* download offline content on smartphone
  * be prepared for not having mobile signal all along the route
* download maps on cycling computer
  * make sure to have the required maps downloaded on your cycling computer

## Packing your bike

* bag options
* bag setups
* accessibility of your stuff

## Clothing

* rain cloths / weather / cold
* special requirements for clothing for longdistance rides (big pockets)
* layered clothing
* plastic bags for warm feet

## Sleeping

* sleeping bag
* how to calm down for sleeping
* powernaps
* ear buts
* cooling down / freezing
* no coffeine before going to bed
* do all other things before sleeping

## Where to sleep

* "dormitories" vs outside
* bank counters ("EC hotel")
* bus stops

## Eating

* be prepared to having different desires during longer rides
* sweet & salty
* salt against cramps
* drops against sore throat

## Shopping

* check opening hours of gas stations and shops along the route
* check your route before-hand and figure out potential bottlenecks of food supply
* eg. Swizzerland all shops will close 20:00

## Overcoming pain

* knee pain
* archilles heel
* numb hands
* numb feet (put of shoes at controls, walk barefoot)

## Emergency kit

* rescue blanket
