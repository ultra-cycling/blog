The idea was to get to the starting point of the BRM200 &amp;ldquo;by fair means&amp;rdquo; (by bike) and thereby add another 200km to make it a BRM 400.

My grandparents used to live in a town that was about 40km away from where my family used to live and we basically went there every weekend. At some point I asked my mum whether it is possible to go there by bike. One sunny day, we made it happen. It came with a surprise on how quickly got there.</description></item><item><title>My name is Michael - I am a father of two, cyclist and occasional photographer.</title><link>https://ultra-cycling.de/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ultra-cycling.de/about/</guid><description>Michael Lihs Father of 👶 and 👧, hobby-cyclist who stumbled into ultra-cycling 🚴🏼‍♂️💨.
