I am planning to pack everything into 2 bags (seat pack and frame pack). As always I will take a sleeping bag with me that allows me to sleep wherever and whenever I want. Besides I will prepare for the 2 bag drops that are offered by the organizers
Clothing Bike shoes Socks (2 pairs) Cycling bibs, short (1 for cycling, 2 in my bag drops) Jersey (3, 1 for cycling and 2 in my bag drops) Armlets Leg warmers Fleece jacket with hoodie Rain Jacket Wind Jacket I will put my rain pants in the 1st bag drop, in case it turns out to be a bad decision to leave them at home Same with my overshoes Reflective vest Helmet Thin scarf to catch the sweat in my face Sun glasses (with additional transparent glasses for the night) Bags Ortlieb seat pack 16.</description></item></channel></rss>
