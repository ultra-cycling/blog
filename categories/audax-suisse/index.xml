Since it is always hard to find the secret hidden tracks and scenic highlights along the route, involing locals sounded like a great plan. Since I was still living in Stuttgart at this time, we had the idea to offer a 400km brevet from Buch (home town of Audax Suisse) to Stuttgart and back.</description></item><item><title>BRM 200 Audax Suisse</title><link>https://ultra-cycling.de/blog/2022-04-22-brm-200-bodensee/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2022 11:08:48 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://ultra-cycling.de/blog/2022-04-22-brm-200-bodensee/</guid><description>The route planning Since London-Edinburgh-London is approaching at great speed (I realised there are only 3 more months for preparation), I felt the urge for some longer training distances. The idea was to get to the starting point of the BRM200 &amp;ldquo;by fair means&amp;rdquo; (by bike) and thereby add another 200km to make it a BRM 400. Besides, there is also another BRM 600 in the planning to allow for an early pre-registration for Paris-Brest-Paris in 2023.</description></item></channel></rss>
